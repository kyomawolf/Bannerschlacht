# Bannerschlacht
A small game for testing out C++ 11/17 features.

## Compilation

### prerequisites:
C++ toolchain; I'm using clang v.12 on macos.
Install the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) into any linker included search path or locally in the folder `lib` in `updated`. You may need opengl as well.

### compilation:
With the raylib you should, in general, be able to install it onto any system supported by raylib (linux, macos, windows).

Enter the folder `updated` and use the `make` command to compile the program. The program should compile, if it doesn't, fix it and create a pull request ;)
